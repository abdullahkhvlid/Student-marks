# Student-marks
Student Marks and Grade Calculator
This Python script is a straightforward yet robust tool designed to capture student marks across multiple subjects, calculate the overall percentage, and determine the corresponding grade based on predefined thresholds.

Features
Dynamic Input Handling: Prompts the user to enter the name and marks for each subject dynamically.

Data Storage: Efficiently stores subject names and marks in a dictionary for easy reference.

Error Handling: Implements exception handling to manage invalid input gracefully, ensuring the program does not crash on erroneous entries.

Grade Calculation: Computes the average percentage from the entered marks and assigns a grade according to specified percentage ranges.

User Feedback: Provides clear output showing the entered marks, calculated percentage, and final grade.

Usage
The user is prompted to input the name and marks for each subject iteratively. After collecting the data, the script outputs the studentâ€™s marks per subject, their overall percentage, and the grade classification.

Grade Scale
A1: Percentage above 80%

A: Percentage between 79% and 69%

B: Percentage between 69% and 59%

C: Percentage between 59% and 0%

F: Failing grade for any other case

Code Reliability
The program incorporates robust exception handling to ensure only valid numerical marks are accepted, improving user experience and data integrity.
